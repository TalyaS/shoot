# Shoot

Shoot is a helper library to take screenshots using BrowserStack. If you don't need a full integration test coupled with screenshots, it's a simpler choice.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoot'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Also add the following environment variables: `BROWSERSTACK_USER` and `BROWSERSTACK_KEY`. The way you do it is up to you (we recommend either dotenv or an export in your personal files).

## Usage

Shoot installs a binary. To inspect it, just run:

    $ shoot
    
The first thing you should do is:
 
    $ shoot list
	ID   OS #                Browser #     Device
	0    OS X Snow Leopard   safari 5.1
	1    OS X Snow Leopard   chrome 14.0
	2    OS X Snow Leopard   chrome 16.0
	...
	537  ios 7.0             ipad          iPad mini Retina
	538  ios 7.0             iphone        iPhone 5S
	539  ios 7.0             iphone        iPhone 5C
	
The `list` command basically fetches all browsers available on BrowserStack and caches them locally on `.screenshots/.browsers.json`. You can choose to add this folder on your `.gitignore`, since shoot will save all images there as well.

Then, you can choose to activate the browsers you wanna use, based on id. Example:

	$ shoot activate 2

This will activate (given your output is the same as above) chrome 16 on OS X Snow Leopard.

Now, create a scenario. Here's an example:

```ruby
class MyScenario < Shoot::Scenario
	def login
		visit "http://url.to.login"
	end
end
```

As you can see, it follows [capybara's](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) syntax, so you can visit pages, fill forms, click links and so on...

Now run:

	$ shoot scenario my_scenario.rb
	
This will run all the methods of MyScenario and generate screenshots for all active browsers.

The resulting images will be saved on <font size="7">	`.screenshots`</font> folder.

If you wanna just test your scenarios, without paying SauceLabs and wasting time with remote connections:

	$ shoot test my_scenario.rb
	
Or you can run a whole folder, like:

	$ shoot test my_scenarios/

The `test` command will run locally using phantomjs (capybara).

You can choose to deactivate the browsers you don't wanna use, based on id as well. Example:

	$ shoot deactivate 2

This will deactivate (given your output is the same as above) chrome 16 on OS X Snow Leopard.

If you want to deactivate all the active browsers at once you can run:

	$ shoot deactivate_all

To open all screenshots (on a Mac), run:

	$ shoot open
